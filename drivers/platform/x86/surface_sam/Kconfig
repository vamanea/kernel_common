	help
	  Drivers for the Surface/System Aggregator Module (SAM) of Microsoft
	  Surface devices.

	  SAM is an embedded controller that provides access to various
	  functionalities on these devices, including battery status, keyboard
	  events (on the Laptops) and many more.

	  Say M/Y here if you have a Microsoft Surface device with a SAM device
	  (i.e. 5th generation or later).

config SURFACE_SAM_SSH

	depends on SERIAL_DEV_CTRL_TTYPORT
	select CRC_CCITT
	default m
	help
	  Surface Serial Hub driver for 5th generation (or later) Microsoft
	  Surface devices.

	  This is the base driver for the embedded serial controller found on
	  5th generation (and later) Microsoft Surface devices (e.g. Book 2,
	  Laptop, Laptop 2, Pro 2017, Pro 6, ...). This driver itself only
	  provides access to the embedded controller (SAM) and subsequent
	  drivers are required for the respective functionalities.

	  If you have a 5th generation (or later) Microsoft Surface device, say
	  Y or M here.

config SURFACE_SAM_SSH_ERROR_INJECTION
	bool "Surface Serial Hub Error Injection Capabilities"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	depends on FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION
	default n
	help
	  Enable error injection capabilities for the Surface Serial Hub.
	  This is used to debug the driver, specifically the communication
	  interface. It is not required for normal use.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config SURFACE_SAM_DEBUGFS
	tristate "Surface Serial Hub Debug Device"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	depends on DEBUG_FS
	default n
	help
	  Debug device for direct communication with the embedded controller
	  found on 5th generation (and later) Microsoft Surface devices (e.g.
	  Book 2, Laptop, Laptop 2, Pro 2017, Pro 6, ...) via debugfs.

	  If you are not sure, say N here.

config SURFACE_SAM_SAN
	tristate "Surface ACPI Notify Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	default m
	help
	  Surface ACPI Notify driver for 5th generation (or later) Microsoft
	  Surface devices.

	  This driver enables basic ACPI events and requests, such as battery
	  status requests/events, thermal events, lid status, and possibly more,
	  which would otherwise not work on these devices.

	  If you are not sure, say M here.

config SURFACE_SAM_VHF
	tristate "Surface Virtual HID Framework Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	depends on HID
	default m
	help
	  Surface Virtual HID Framework driver for 5th generation (or later)
	  Microsoft Surface devices.

	  This driver provides support for the Microsoft Virtual HID framework,
	  which is required for keyboard support on the Surface Laptop 1 and 2.

	  If you are not sure, say M here.

config SURFACE_SAM_DTX
	tristate "Surface Detachment System (DTX) Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	depends on INPUT
	default m
	help
	  Surface Detachment System (DTX) driver for the Microsoft Surface Book
	  2. This driver provides support for proper detachment handling in
	  user-space, status-events relating to the base and support for
	  the safe-guard keeping the base attached when the discrete GPU
	  contained in it is running via the special /dev/surface-dtx device.

	  Also provides a standard input device to provide SW_TABLET_MODE events
	  upon device mode change.

	  If you are not sure, say M here.

config SURFACE_SAM_HPS
	tristate "Surface dGPU Hot-Plug System (dGPU-HPS) Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SAN
	depends on GPIO_SYSFS
	default m
	help
	  Driver to properly handle hot-plugging and explicit power-on/power-off
	  of the discrete GPU (dGPU) on the Surface Book 2 and 3.

	  If you are not sure, say M here.

config SURFACE_SAM_SID
	tristate "Surface Platform Integration Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SSH
	default m
	help
	  Surface Platform Integration Driver for the Microsoft Surface Devices.
	  This driver loads various model-specific sub-drivers, including
	  battery and keyboard support on 7th generation Surface devices, proper
	  lid setup to enable device wakeup when the lid is opened on multiple
	  models, as well as performance mode setting support on the Surface
	  Book 2.

	  If you are not sure, say M here.

config SURFACE_SAM_SID_GPELID
	tristate "Surface Lid Wakeup Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SID
	default m
	help
	  Driver to set up device wake-up via lid on Intel-based Microsoft
	  Surface devices. These devices do not wake up from sleep as their GPE
	  interrupt is not configured automatically. This driver solves that
	  problem.

	  If you are not sure, say M here.

config SURFACE_SAM_SID_PERFMODE
	tristate "Surface Performance Mode Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SID
	depends on SYSFS
	default m
	help
	  This driver provides support for setting performance-modes on Surface
	  devices via the perf_mode sysfs attribute. Currently only supports the
	  Surface Book 2. Performance-modes directly influence the fan-profile
	  of the device, allowing to choose between higher performance or
	  quieter operation.

	  If you are not sure, say M here.

config SURFACE_SAM_SID_VHF
	tristate "Surface SAM HID Driver"
	depends on SURFACE_SAM_SID
	depends on HID
	default m
	help
	  This driver provides support for HID devices connected via the Surface
	  SAM embedded controller. It provides support for keyboard and touchpad
	  on the Surface Laptop 3 models.

	  If you are not sure, say M here.
