/*
 * To simplify reasoning about the code below, we define a few concepts. The
 * system below is similar to a state-machine for packets, however, there are
 * too many states to explicitly write them down. To (somewhat) manage the
 * states and packets we rely on flags, reference counting, and some simple
 * concepts. State transitions are triggered by actions.
 *
 * >> Actions <<
 *
 * - submit
 * - transmission start (process next item in queue)
 * - transmission finished (guaranteed to never be parallel to transmission
 *   start)
 * - ACK received
 * - NAK received (this is equivalent to issuing re-submit for all pending
 *   packets)
 * - timeout (this is equivalent to re-issuing a submit or canceling)
 * - cancel (non-pending and pending)
 *
 * >> Data Structures, Packet Ownership, General Overview <<
 *
 * The code below employs two main data structures: The packet queue, containing
 * all packets scheduled for transmission, and the set of pending packets,
 * containing all packets awaiting an ACK.
 *
 * Shared ownership of a packet is controlled via reference counting. Inside the
 * transmission system are a total of five packet owners:
 *
 * - the packet queue,
 * - the pending set,
 * - the transmitter thread,
 * - the receiver thread (via ACKing), and
 * - the timeout work item.
 *
 * Normal operation is as follows: The initial reference of the packet is
 * obtained by submitting the packet and queueing it. The receiver thread
 * takes packets from the queue. By doing this, it does not increment the
 * refcount but takes over the reference (removing it from the queue).
 * If the packet is sequenced (i.e. needs to be ACKed by the client), the
 * transmitter thread sets-up the timeout and adds the packet to the pending set
 * before starting to transmit it. As the timeout is handled by a reaper task,
 * no additional reference for it is needed. After the transmit is done, the
 * reference hold by the transmitter thread is dropped. If the packet is
 * unsequenced (i.e. does not need an ACK), the packet is completed by the
 * transmitter thread before dropping that reference.
 *
 * On receial of an ACK, the receiver thread removes and obtains the refernce to
 * the packet from the pending set. On succes, the receiver thread will then
 * complete the packet and drop its reference.
 *
 * On error, the completion callback is immediately run by on thread on which
 * the error was detected.
 *
 * To ensure that a packet eventually leaves the system it is marked as "locked"
 * directly before it is going to be completed or when it is canceled. Marking a
 * packet as "locked" has the effect that passing and creating new references
 * of the packet will be blocked. This means that the packet cannot be added
 * to the queue, the pending set, and the timeout, or be picked up by the
 * transmitter thread or receiver thread. To remove a packet from the system it
 * has to be marked as locked and subsequently all references from the data
 * structures (queue, pending) have to be removed. References held by threads
 * will eventually be dropped automatically as their execution progresses.
 *
 * Note that the packet completion callback is, in case of success and for a
 * sequenced packet, guaranteed to run on the receiver thread, thus providing a
 * way to reliably identify responses to the packet. The packet completion
 * callback is only run once and it does not indicate that the packet has fully
 * left the system. In case of re-submission (and with somewhat unlikely
 * timing), it may be possible that the packet is being re-transmitted while the
 * completion callback runs. Completion will occur both on success and internal
 * error, as well as when the packet is canceled.
 *
 * >> Flags <<
 *
 * Flags are used to indicate the state and progression of a packet. Some flags
 * have stricter guarantees than other:
 *
 * - locked
 *   Indicates if the packet is locked. If the packet is locked, passing and/or
 *   creating additional references to the packet is forbidden. The packet thus
 *   may not be queued, dequeued, or removed or added to the pending set. Note
 *   that the packet state flags may still change (e.g. it may be marked as
 *   ACKed, transmitted, ...).
 *
 * - completed
 *   Indicates if the packet completion has been run or is about to be run. This
 *   flag is used to ensure that the packet completion callback is only run
 *   once.
 *
 * - queued
 *   Indicates if a packet is present in the submission queue or not. This flag
 *   must only be modified with the queue lock held, and must be coherent
 *   presence of the packet in the queue.
 *
 * - pending
 *   Indicates if a packet is present in the set of pending packets or not.
 *   This flag must only be modified with the pending lock held, and must be
 *   coherent presence of the packet in the pending set.
 *
 * - transmitting
 *   Indicates if the packet is currently transmitting. In case of
 *   re-transmissions, it is only safe to wait on the "transmitted" completion
 *   after this flag has been set. The completion will be set both in success
 *   and error case.
 *
 * - transmitted
 *   Indicates if the packet has been transmitted. This flag is not cleared by
 *   the system, thus it indicates the first transmission only.
 *
 * - acked
 *   Indicates if the packet has been acknowledged by the client. There are no
 *   other guarantees given. For example, the packet may still be canceled
 *   and/or the completion may be triggered an error even though this bit is
 *   set. Rely on the status provided by completion instead.
 *
 * - canceled
 *   Indicates if the packet has been canceled from the outside. There are no
 *   other guarantees given. Specifically, the packet may be completed by
 *   another part of the system before the cancellation attempts to complete it.
 *
 * >> General Notes <<
 *
 * To avoid deadlocks, if both queue and pending locks are required, the pending
 * lock must be acquired before the queue lock.
